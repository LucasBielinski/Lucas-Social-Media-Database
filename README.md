# Social-media-database

## Description

This project is my first project where Mongodb is used. I built this project as a way to test the limitations and capabilities of Mongodb. I wanted to see the similarities and differences between MySql and Mongoose. This is an example of a social media database, where users can add each other as friends, make posts, and comment on posts. This way I can understand how a non-relational database works.

## Installation

The following node programs must be installed if running from the terminal, express and mongoose.

## Usage

In order to use this project, simply clone the repository, npm i the necessary dependencies, and use npm start to start the server. Insomnia must be used to access the routes and make changes to the database.
